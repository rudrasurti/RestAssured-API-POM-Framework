The given project is a RestAssured-based API testing framework. It utilizes the RestAssured library for API testing, TestNG for running tests, and Extent Reports for generating interactive and detailed test reports.

Here is an overview of the project structure:

### Framework Details
- Base API: The project uses the Restful-booker API as the basis for the API testing framework. It is a Create Read Update Delete Web API with authentication features.
- Framework: The framework is designed to solve common software requirements by providing a base code that can be built upon.
- Project structure: The project follows a standard Maven Java project structure with a POM.xml file.

### Packages
- Main Package: Contains sub-packages dedicated to various API testing functionalities.
  - com.restfulbooker.apitest.actions: Contains Java Enum types for different HTTP operations and response validators.
  - com.restfulbooker.apitest.interfaces: Contains the IApi interface, which provides methods for API testing and assertion.
  - com.restfulbooker.apitest.listeners: Contains classes for managing Extent Reports and TestNG listeners.
  - com.restfulbooker.apitest.restassuredFunctions: Contains the API class that implements the IApi interface and defines the API testing functionality using RestAssured.
  - com.restfulbooker.apitest.utilities: Contains utility classes for database connection, SSH remote server connection, and other reusable functions.
  - com.restfulbooker.apitest.baseAPI: Contains API entities with request data properties for each API endpoint.

### Test Package
- com.restfulbooker.apitest.businessLogics: Contains the test classes (TestNG) related to the restfulbooker application.

### Reports
- Extent Reports: The framework uses Extent Reports library to generate interactive and detailed test reports. The reports can be found in the `workingDir/ExtentReports/ExtentReportResults.html` file.

The installation process and steps to set up API automation in a local system are also provided in the project documentation.

The example test demonstrates how to use the framework to test the login API of a booking site. It includes details about the API, request headers, request body, and expected response. The steps to create a base API for the login API are also explained.

Please note that the code snippets provided in the example are incomplete and may not work without the complete implementation of the respective classes and methods.
